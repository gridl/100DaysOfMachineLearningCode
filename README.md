# 100DaysOfMachineLearningCode
100 days ML roadmap to become a Machine Learning engineer.

## Day 1 - June 13
### Computer Vision:
#### Work Done:
Face and eye detection in OpenCV using Haar cascades. Also wrote a tutorial on how to do this and published in medium.
#### Challange Faced:
Haar cascade is not much powerful since it is only for front side faced faces and it is not based upon neural network or so. But it does a good job for simple applications
