# 100DaysOfMachineLearningCode
100 days ML roadmap to become a Machine Learning engineer.

## Day 1 - June 13
### Computer Vision:
#### Work Done:
Face and eye detection in OpenCV using Haar cascades. Also wrote a tutorial on how to do this and published in medium.
Blogpost for face detection is published in: https://blog.goodaudience.com/real-time-face-and-eyes-detection-with-opencv-54d9ccfee6a8


#### Challange Faced:
Haar cascade is not much powerful since it is only for front side faced faces and it is not based upon neural network or so. But it does a good job for simple applications

## Day 2 - June 14
### Computer Vision:
#### Work Done:

Learned about SSD(Single Shot MUltiBox Detection) algorithm. There is another competitor in the filed called YOLO(You Only Look Once) algorithm. SSD is used for object localization, classification and detection.

#### Challance Faced:
SSD is a complex algorithm. It is based on CNN. It has rivals R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN. It can be difficult to pick up correct algorithm for correct task

## Day 3 - June 15
### Computer Vision:
#### Work Done:

Wrote a blog post about SSD alogrithm. Learned foundation of Convolutional Neural Networks.
