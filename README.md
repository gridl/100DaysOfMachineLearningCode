# 100DaysOfMachineLearningCode
100 days ML roadmap to become a Machine Learning engineer.

## Day 1 - June 13
### Computer Vision:
#### Today's Work:
Face and eye detection in OpenCV using Haar cascades. Also wrote a tutorial on how to do this and published in medium.
Blogpost for face detection is published in: https://blog.goodaudience.com/real-time-face-and-eyes-detection-with-opencv-54d9ccfee6a8


#### Thoughts:
Haar cascade is not much powerful since it is only for front side faced faces and it is not based upon neural network or so. But it does a good job for simple applications

## Day 2 - June 14
### Computer Vision:
#### Today's work:

Learned about SSD(Single Shot MUltiBox Detection) algorithm. There is another competitor in the filed called YOLO(You Only Look Once) algorithm. SSD is used for object localization, classification and detection.

#### Thoughts:
SSD is a complex algorithm. It is based on CNN. It has rivals R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN. It can be difficult to pick up correct algorithm for correct task

## Day 3 - June 15
### Computer Vision:
#### Today's Progress:
Wrote a blog post about SSD alogrithm. Learned foundation of Convolutional Neural Networks. In CNN the image scale gets decreases in each convolution but preserves the features so it can identify objects of any scale

#### Thoughts:
CNN is new for me so it is taking time
